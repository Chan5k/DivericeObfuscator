# DivericeObfuscator
A simple script to obfuscate files using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.
# Getting Started
To use the obfuscator, you'll need to install the cryptography library:
        
        pip install cryptography
You'll also need to install the colorama library:
    
        pip install colorama
# Usage
Run the script in your terminal and enter the name of the file you want to obfuscate when prompted. The script will generate a new Fernet key and encrypt the contents of the file, writing the encrypted contents to a new file with a .obf extension. The key used for encryption will be displayed at the end of the process:

        py encrypt-updated.py
